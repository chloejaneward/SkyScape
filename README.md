# SkyScape

SkyScape is a website for a fictional aerial arts studio. The business operates like a gym and has classes scheduled weekly for aerial hoop, silks and trapeze. The website has a dual purpose; to advertise classes to new customers, and to inform current customers of class times. It will also provide information on how to get in touch with the business owners. 

Here is a link to the deployed site:

The theme will be based on pastel sky, pink and light blue tones in background to illustrate the SkyScape theme and the elegant nature of aerial arts. Also in line with the fact that aerial arts are done in the air.

#### Colours:

Colours for the site have taken inspiration from a pastel night sky, with light hues of purple and pinks. 

A colour scheme has been chosen by using Coolors.co :
